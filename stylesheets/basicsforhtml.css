/* there are three ways of implementing css to your html document */
/* priority wise they can be given as inline css.... interanl css.... and external css */

    adjacent selector so in these case the css property will be applied to only those <p> tag
    which are just adjacent to <h1> tag. adjacent tag can be very helpful in targetting a particular tag in your HTML document  */

/* child selector uses (>) operator to link a tag inside another tag. Child selector is also a kind of relative tag as it is only applied to those 
    thsoe tags which are inside a particular tag. For example when we use this given child selector [div>p] the css code will only be applied to those 
    <p> tag which are present inside the <div> tag. child selector can also play very important role in selecting a tag within some particular tag */

/* property selector () uses data type name or any other property of any tag as an property of any element. TO acess this from css
