<!-- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
It is used for developing Web Pages -->
<!-- There are basically two sections in an HTML document 
<head></head> tag and <body> </body> tag -->

    <meta name="author" content="Saharsh Gupta" />

    <!-- here we give title to a webpage which appears
            on top as a tag -->

    <title>
        Basics
    </title>

    <!-- This link tab is used for linking an external file with HTML document -->

    <link href="stylesheets/basicsforhtml.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/CSS" />

    <!-- Base tag is used for setting up default path for a file 
instead of giving the complete address in img tag we just use the file name
as we have already saved the whole mess of link in our base href tag-->

    <base href="http://gujaratiinnovative.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/">

<body>

    <!-- this is a body tag. here we keep all our contents which is displayed on
        our webpage it consist a lot of other tags as it consist of everyhthing that 
        is displayed over webpage -->

    <!-- From here we are starting our Paragraph <p> tag which is used for
        giving contents to your body. it also provide us with the space 
        required to distinguish between two html documents -->


    <p>What is Lorem Ipsum?
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
        standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make
        a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
        remaining essentially unchanged. It was <br> popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
        Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
        of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

        <!-- br tag is used for breaking row or to move down to a next lins -->

    <p>Why do we use it?
        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at
        its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as
        opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing
        packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum'
        will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
        accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
